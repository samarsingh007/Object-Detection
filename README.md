# Object Detection Using YOLO

## Introduction
This project introduces a lightweight, efficient YOLO model for object detection, designed to reduce computational requirements while maintaining high detection performance. This model is a great choice for real-time applications and devices with limited computational resources.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- TensorFlow 2
- OpenCV
- Numpy

## Getting Started

To get started with the object detection model, use the following commands for prediction, training, evaluation, and running a webcam demo:

### Predict
```bash
python3 main.py -p cfg/predict_coco.cfg
